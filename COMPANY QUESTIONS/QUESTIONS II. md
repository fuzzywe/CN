[9/27, 1:54 PM] Janani: RSA Algorithm 
RSA algorithm is an asymmetric cryptography algorithm. Asymmetric actually means that it works on two different keys i.e. Public Key and Private Key. As the name describes, the Public Key is given to everyone and the Private key is kept private.

An example of asymmetric cryptography : A client (for example browser) sends its public key to the server and requests for some data. The server encrypts the data using the client's public key and sends the encrypted data. Client receives this data and decrypts it. Since this is asymmetric, nobody else except the browser can decrypt the data even if a third party has the public key of the browser.

What is HTTP and HTTPS protocol ? 
HTTP is the HyperText Transfer Protocol which defines the set of rules and standards on how the information can be transmitted on the World Wide Web (WWW). It helps the web browsers and web servers for communication. It is a ‘stateless protocol’ where each command is independent with respect to the previous command. HTTP is an application layer protocol built upon the TCP. It uses port 80 by default. HTTPS is the HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure or Secure HTTP. It is an advanced and a secured version of HTTP. On top of HTTP, SSL/TLS protocol is used to provide security. It enables secure transactions by encrypting the communication and also helps identify network servers securely. It uses port 443 by default.

What is SMTP protocol ? 
SMTP is the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol. SMTP sets the rule for communication between servers. This set of rules helps the software to transmit emails over the internet. It supports both End-to-End and Store-and-Forward methods. It is in always-listening mode on port 25.

TCP and UDP protocol, prepare differences
TCP is a connection-oriented protocol, whereas UDP is a connectionless protocol. A key difference between TCP and UDP is speed, as TCP is comparatively slower than UDP. Overall, UDP is a much faster, simpler, and
efficient protocol, however, retransmission of lost data packets is only possible with TCP.

TCP provides extensive error checking mechanisms. It is because it provides flow control and acknowledgment of data. UDP has only the basic error checking mechanism using checksums.

What happens when you enter “google.com” (very very famous question) 
Check the browser cache first if the content is fresh and present in the cache display the same.
If not, the browser checks if the IP of the URL is present in the cache (browser and OS) if not then requests the OS to do a DNS lookup using UDP to get the corresponding IP address of the URL from the DNS server to establish a new TCP connection.
A new TCP connection is set between the browser and the server using three-way handshaking.
An HTTP request is sent to the server using the TCP connection.
The web servers running on the Servers handle the incoming HTTP request and send the HTTP response.
The browser processes the HTTP response sent by the server and may close the TCP connection or reuse the same for future requests.
If the response data is cacheable then browsers cache the same.
Browser decodes the response and renders the content.
Hub vs Switch 
Hub: Hub is a networking device which is used to transmit the signal to each port
(except one port) to respond from which the signal was received. Hub is operated on a Physical layer. In this packet filtering is not available. It is of two types: Active Hub, Passive Hub.

Switch: Switch is a network device which is used to enable the connection
establishment and connection termination on the basis of need. Switch is operated on the Data link layer. In this packet filtering is available. It is a type of full duplex
transmission mode and it is also called an efficient bridge

VPN, advantages and disadvantages of it 
VPN (Virtual Private Network) : VPN or the Virtual Private Network is a private WAN
(Wide Area Network) built on the internet. It allows the creation of a secured tunnel
(protected network) between different networks using the internet (public network). By using the VPN, a client can connect to the organisation’s network remotely.

Advantages of VPN :
1. VPN is used to connect offices in different geographical locations remotely and is
cheaper when compared to WAN connections.
2. VPN is used for secure transactions and confidential data transfer between
multiple offices located in different geographical locations.
3. VPN keeps an organisation’s information secured against any potential threats or
intrusions by using virtualization.
4. VPN encrypts the internet traffic and disguises the online identity

Disadvantages of VPN :
1. Not designed for continuous use
2. Complexity prevents scalability
3. Lack of granular security
4. Unpredictable performance
5. Unreliable availability

LAN
A local area network (LAN) is a collection of devices connected together in one physical location, such as a building, office, or home. A LAN can be small or large, ranging from a home network with one user to an enterprise network with thousands of users and devices in an office or school.

[9/30, 11:13 AM] Janani: POP3 vs. IMAP vs. SMTP
POP3, IMAP and SMTP are all email protocols. The three protocols differ in a variety of ways, including:
POP3 and IMAP are protocols for retrieving emails from a server, while SMTP is for transmitting emails.
POP3 downloads messages directly to your device. In comparison, IMAP retains the message on the server.
POP3 frees up storage space on servers, but IMAP frees up space on local hard drives.
While IMAP synchronizes email content across devices, POP3 keeps separate settings and email content on different devices.
IMAP can be identically useful for multiple devices, while POP3 is more suitable for use on a single device because of its synchronization inability.
POP3 retrieves only the emails within your inbox folder. In contrast, IMAP retrieves content from every folder in your email account.
POP3 poses a greater risk of device infection as it downloads all inbox messages to the local device. Comparatively, IMAP allows you to control which emails and attachments you open
POP3 misses an automatic backup system, meaning you can easily lose data. In contrast, IMAP allows you to re-retrieve any emails you haven't deleted
[9/30, 11:17 AM] Janani: The transport layer is known as the "heart" of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model because it performs many important functions, including: 
 
Reliable data transfer
The transport layer ensures that data packets arrive accurately and reliably between the sender and receiver. 
 
Error checking
The transport layer performs error checking to ensure that the transmission is free of errors. 
 
Data segmentation
The transport layer breaks data from the session layer into segments for the network layer. 
 
Data reassembly
The transport layer reassembles the segments from the network layer and passes them on to the session layer. 
 
Flow control
The transport layer avoids sending more data than can be reliably transmitted. 
 
Addressing
The transport layer communicates with the correct application on the computer. 
 
Multiplexing
The transport layer ensures that any number of applications can use any number of network connections. 
 
The transport layer uses transmission protocols like the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP) to manage network traffic.
[9/30, 11:37 AM] Janani: A unique difference between a router and a gateway lies in their handling of protocols:

Router: A router forwards data within the same protocol (e.g., IPv4 to IPv4, IPv6 to IPv6). It decides the optimal path for data within networks using the same communication protocol.

Gateway: A gateway converts data between different protocols. For instance, it can translate between IPv4 and IPv6, or even between entirely different systems like TCP/IP and telephony protocols.


This protocol conversion capability is what sets gateways apart from routers in a unique way.
[10/9, 3:23 PM] Janani: Do I need a modem and a router?
A modem and router are both essential components of most home networks, especially for those who have a home office and work remotely. The modem is responsible for sending and receiving signals from the ISP, while the router disperses the signal to devices on the network.

In a typical home network setup, the modem is connected to the router, which is then connected to each device on the network. The modem and router are essential in ensuring a stable and reliable connection. Without a modem, the router would not be able to connect to the internet, and without a router, devices on the network would not be able to communicate
[10/19, 5:00 PM] Ruthika: What is CSMA protocol?

Problem approach
Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA) is a network protocol for carriertransmission that operates in the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer. It senses or listens whether the shared channel for transmission is busy or not, and transmits if the channel is not busy. Using CMSA protocols, more than one users or nodes send and receive data through a shared medium that may be a single cable or optical fiber connecting multiple nodes, or a portion of the wireless spectrum.

Working Principle
When a station has frames to transmit, it attempts to detect presence of the carrier signal from the other nodes connected to the shared channel. If a carrier signal is detected, it implies that a transmission is in progress. The station waits till the ongoing transmission executes to completion, and then initiates its own transmission. Generally, transmissions by the node are received by all other nodes connected to the channel.
Since, the nodes detect for a transmission before sending their own frames,collision of frames is reduced. However, if two nodes detect an idle channel at the same time, they may simultaneously initiate transmission. This would cause the frames to garble resulting in a collision.
[10/21, 6:47 PM] Ruthika: Bandwidth is how much information you receive every second, while speed is how fast that information is received or downloaded
[10/21, 6:49 PM] Ruthika: latency is the amount of time it takes that information to get from its source to you.
[10/21, 6:50 PM] Ruthika: It's the lag you experience while waiting for something to load
[10/21, 6:51 PM] Ruthika: Throughput is how much information actually gets delivered in a certain amount of time. So if bandwidth is the max amount of data, throughput is how much of that data makes it to its destination –
[10/21, 7:48 PM] Ruthika: DNS Forwarder: A DNS forwarder is like a smart assistant in the network. When a computer doesn’t know the answer to a DNS query, the forwarder steps in, sending the request to another DNS server and then saving the answer for future requests. This speeds things up and takes the load off your local DNS server
